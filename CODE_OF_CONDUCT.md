# Kaster Protocol Code of Conduct

## About This Project

This repository contains a **reference interface** for the **Kaster Protocol**, a message formatting specification for decentralized messaging on the Kaspa blockDAG. This interface is provided solely for **educational and technical demonstration purposes** to illustrate the protocol's capabilities.

## Technical Architecture and Responsibilities

### Clear Role Definition

- **Kaster Protocol**: A technical specification that defines how to format messages for blockDAG storage
- **KasWare Wallet Extension**: Handles all blockDAG transactions and writes the formatted payload to the Kaspa blockDAG
- **Reference Interface**: A demonstration tool that formats messages according to the Kaster Protocol and interfaces with KasWare
- **Kaspa BlockDAG**: The decentralized ledger where KasWare permanently stores the transaction payloads

### Responsibility Chain

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- **We (this project)** only provide message formatting specifications and a demonstration interface
- **KasWare Extension** handles all actual blockDAG transactions and payload inscription
- **Individual users** initiate transactions through their KasWare wallet
- **The Kaspa Network** provides the decentralized blockDAG storage infrastructure

## Legal and Technical Disclaimers

### What We Control
- The Kaster Protocol message format specification
- This reference interface code and documentation
- Local filtering and display features in the interface

### What We Do NOT Control
- KasWare wallet extension transactions
- Content written to the Kaspa blockDAG by users' wallets
- Individual users' decisions to publish content
- The decentralized Kaspa network infrastructure

### User Responsibility
Each participant is **solely responsible** for:
- Their use of KasWare to publish transactions
- Content they choose to format and publish via their wallet
- Compliance with laws in their jurisdiction
- Understanding the permanent nature of blockDAG storage

## Expected Behavior

While we cannot control what users publish through their KasWare wallets, we strongly encourage all protocol participants to:

### ✅ Encouraged Behaviors
- Respect local, national, and international laws
- Maintain respectful and constructive discourse
- Use the protocol for technical and educational purposes
- Report problematic content via local filtering tools

### ❌ Strictly Discouraged Content
In accordance with the interface's legal consent modal, we strongly discourage formatting and publishing content that is:

- Illegal under applicable laws
- Racist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic, or discriminatory
- Hateful, harassing, or threatening towards others
- Defamatory, slanderous, or damaging to reputation
- Of illegal pornographic nature
- Inciting violence, terrorism, or criminal activities
- Violating copyright or intellectual property rights
- Constituting scams, spam, or fraudulent attempts

## Local Moderation Tools

The reference interface provides **client-side filtering tools** allowing users to:

- **Hide specific messages** (stored locally in browser)
- **Blacklist wallet addresses** (local filtering only)
- **Filter unwanted terms** (local keyword system)

These tools only affect local display and do not remove content from the blockDAG, as that content was written by users' own wallets.

## Content Reporting and Support

For reporting problematic content, consult our [Reporting Guide](REPORTING.md).

## Scope of This Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies to:

- This GitHub repository and its contributions
- Discussions in issues and pull requests
- Documentation and provided examples
- The reference interface development

**It does NOT apply** to:
- Content users publish via their KasWare wallets
- KasWare extension functionality
- The Kaspa blockDAG network

## Enforcement

Violations of this code of conduct within this GitHub repository context may result in:

- Removal of problematic comments or issues
- Repository access restrictions
- GitHub project bans

**Note**: We cannot enforce this code of conduct on content published by users through KasWare onto the Kaspa blockDAG, as this is controlled by individual wallets and the decentralized network.

For questions about this code of conduct or this project, please open a GitHub issue.

*This code of conduct is specific to this technical demonstration repository. The Kaster Protocol is a message formatting specification, and the actual blockDAG transactions are handled by users' KasWare wallets independently.*
