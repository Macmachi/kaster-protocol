# Content Reporting Guide

## Important: Understanding the Decentralized Architecture

Before reporting content, please understand how the Kaster Protocol ecosystem works:

- **Kaster Protocol**: Defines message formatting specifications only
- **KasWare Wallet**: Users' wallets handle all blockDAG transactions and write payloads to the Kaspa blockDAG
- **Reference Interface**: This demonstration tool formats messages and provides local filtering
- **Kaspa BlockDAG**: Decentralized ledger where content is permanently stored by users' wallets

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Point**: Once content is written to the Kaspa blockDAG by a user's KasWare wallet, it cannot be deleted, modified, or censored by anyone, including the authors of this reference implementation.

## What This Project Can and Cannot Do

### ‚úÖ What This Reference Implementation Provides
- Open-source code for educational demonstration
- Local filtering tools for individual users
- Protocol specification documentation
- Example implementation of the Kaster Protocol

### ‚ùå What This Project CANNOT Do
- Remove content from the Kaspa blockDAG
- Control what users publish through their KasWare wallets
- Moderate decentralized blockDAG content
- Take action against wallet addresses
- Provide ongoing support or maintenance

## Self-Help Solutions for Problematic Content

### Use Built-in Local Filtering Tools
The reference interface includes **client-side filtering options**:

1. **Hide Specific Messages**
   - Click the "Hide" button on any message
   - Content is hidden locally in your browser only
   - Does not affect other users or remove from blockDAG

2. **Blacklist Wallet Addresses**
   - Click "Blacklist" on any message
   - All content from that address is hidden locally
   - Personal filtering only, does not affect others

3. **Filter Keywords**
   - Use the "üö´ Filters" button in the interface
   - Add terms you don't want to see
   - Local browser filtering only

### Report Illegal Content to Authorities
For illegal content, contact appropriate authorities:
- **Local Law Enforcement**: For content violating your local laws
- **Interpol**: For international criminal content
- **National Cybercrime Units**: For cyber-related offenses

### Community Solutions
- **Fork this repository** to create your own version with enhanced filtering
- **Contribute improvements** via pull requests (if accepted)
- **Share filtering strategies** with other users

## Understanding Decentralized Moderation

### Traditional Platforms vs. Blockchain Protocols
| Traditional Platform | Kaster Protocol |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Central authority can remove content | No central authority exists |
| Platform controls all data | Users control their own wallets |
| Moderation by platform staff | Self-moderation via local tools |
| Content stored on platform servers | Content stored on decentralized blockDAG |

### Your Responsibility as a User
- **Use filtering tools** to curate your own experience
- **Report illegal content** to appropriate legal authorities
- **Understand blockDAG permanence** before publishing
- **Take personal responsibility** for content consumption
- **Modify the code** if you need different filtering features

## Project Status and Support

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice**: This is a reference implementation provided "as-is" for educational and demonstration purposes. 

- **No ongoing support** is guaranteed or provided
- **No maintenance commitments** are made
- **Issues may not be addressed** or responded to
- **Pull requests may not be reviewed** or merged
- **This is not a commercial service** or platform

## Alternative Solutions

If the decentralized nature doesn't meet your needs:
- **Traditional social platforms** offer centralized moderation
- **Private messaging apps** provide controlled environments
- **Moderated forums** have active content management
- **Fork this project** to create your own version with different rules

## Legal Disclaimers

- This project's authors are not responsible for content published by users via their wallets
- No control exists over the decentralized Kaspa network
- Each user is responsible for their compliance with local laws
- This reference implementation is provided without warranty of any kind
- No ongoing support, updates, or maintenance is guaranteed

## Contact Information

- **GitHub Issues**: Available but may not receive responses
- **Pull Requests**: May be considered but no guarantee of review
- **General Questions**: No dedicated support channel provided
